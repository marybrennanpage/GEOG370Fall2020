<h1>Homework 9: Make a choropleth or proportional symbol map</h1>
<h2>Mary Page</h2>

<h3> Topic: North Carolina COVID-19 Cases and Deaths</h3>
<dt> I chose this topic because I have several family members that work in healthcare, so COVID-19 cases are frequently discussed amongst my family.</dt>

<h3>Choropleth Maps:</h3>
<h4>Cases Choropleth Map</h4>

    </a>
    <dt> This map shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in North Carolina per county. Unsuprisingly, both Wake and Mecklenburg and their nearby counties, which have high populations, have the most number of COVID-19 cases. However, I was suprised that most counties have only had between 116-5000 cases.</dt>

<h4>Cases Per 10k Residents Choropleth Map</h4>

    <dt> This map shows North Carolina COVID-19 cases per 10k residents per county. This map shows much more variation than the previous map. I find this map interesting, as several counties with lower total counts of COVID-19 cases (116-5000), have a high number of cases per 10k residents. For example, Greene, Sampson, Dublin, Stanly and other counties have fairly low counts of COVID-19 cases on the above maps but all have high counts of COVID-19 cases per 10k residents.   </dt>

<h4>Deaths Choropleth Map</h4>
<a href="./deaths.png">
    <img src="./deaths.png" alt="Deaths Choropleth Map" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <dt> This map shows the total number of COVID-19 deaths per county. Similiarly to the cases map, there is not much variation amongst the counties across the state, as most counties have had between 0-100 COVID-19 deaths. And once again, unsuprisingly, Wake and Mecklenburg have fairly high COVID-19 deaths, which can be explained by their high populations. However, interestingly, Rowan, Forsyth and Guilford counties have a higher number of COVID-19 deaths than I would have expected. Perhaps Rowan county's higher number of deaths can be explained by their higher number of cases per 10k residents as seen in the map above.</dt>

<h4>Deaths Per 10k Resdients Choropleth Map</h4>
<a href="./deaths10k.png">
    <img src="./deaths10k.png" alt="HW 9 Map: Deaths Per 10k Resdients Choropleth Map" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <dt> This map shows North Carolina COVID-19 deaths per 10k residents per county. Most of the counties have had between 0-5 COVID-19 deaths per 10k residents, with a number having between 5-10 COVID-19 deaths per 10k residents. Only Montgomery, Hertford, and Jones county have had between 10-15 COVID-19 deaths per 10k residents. Perhaps Montgomery and Hertford counties' higher COVID-19 deaths per 10k residents can be explained by their higher COVID-19 cases per 10k residents.</dt>
