<h1>Homework 9: Make a choropleth or proportional symbol map</h1>
<h2>Mary Page</h2>

<h3> Topic: North Carolina COVID-19 Cases and Deaths</h3>
<dt> I chose this topic because I have several family members that work in healthcare, so COVID-19 cases are frequently discussed amongst my family.</dt>

<h3>Choropleth Maps:</h3>
<h4>Cases Choropleth Map</h4>

    </a>
    <dt> This map shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in North Carolina per county. Unsuprisingly, both Wake and Mecklenburg and their nearby counties, which have high populations, have the most number of COVID-19 cases. However, I was suprised that most counties have only had between 116-5000 cases.</dt>

<h4>Cases Per 10k Residents Choropleth Map</h4>

    <dt> This map shows North Carolina COVID-19 cases per 10k residents per county. This map shows much more variation than the previous map. I find this map interesting, as several counties with lower total counts of COVID-19 cases (116-5000), have a high number of cases per 10k residents. For example, Greene, Sampson, Dublin, Stanly and other counties have fairly low counts of COVID-19 cases on the above maps but all have high counts of COVID-19 cases per 10k residents.   </dt>

<h4>Deaths Choropleth Map</h4>

    <img src="./deaths.png" alt="Deaths Choropleth Map" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <dt> This map shows the total number of COVID-19 deaths per county. Similiarly to the cases map, there is not much variation amongst the counties across the state, as most counties have had between 0-100 COVID-19 deaths. And once again, unsuprisingly, Wake and Mecklenburg have fairly high COVID-19 deaths, which can be explained by their high populations. However, interestingly, Rowan, Forsyth and Guilford counties have a higher number of COVID-19 deaths than I would have expected. Perhaps Rowan county's higher number of deaths can be explained by their higher number of cases per 10k residents as seen in the map above.</dt>

<h4>Deaths Per 10k Resdients Choropleth Map</h4>
<a href="./deaths10k.png">
    <img src="./deaths10k.png" alt="HW 9 Map: Deaths Per 10k Resdients Choropleth Map" width='500px'>
    </a>
    <dt> This map shows North Carolina COVID-19 deaths per 10k residents per county. Most of the counties have had between 0-5 COVID-19 deaths per 10k residents, with a number having between 5-10 COVID-19 deaths per 10k residents. Only Montgomery, Hertford, and Jones county have had between 10-15 COVID-19 deaths per 10k residents. Perhaps Montgomery and Hertford counties' higher COVID-19 deaths per 10k residents can be explained by their higher COVID-19 cases per 10k residents.</dt>

<h3>How I completed this HW:</h3>
<dt> First I found the dataset on the NCDHHS website. However, downloading the data proved tricky, as it said that it was a CSV file but when I would try to open the data in QGIS using 'delimited text' the preview would show that all three columns were not seperated as they should be, and instead everything was in one column. To correct this I used 'Custom delimiters' and selected 'Tab', which then seperated all of the columns as they are supposed to be. Next I downloaded county level data for the entire United States and selected for NC using "STATEFP" = '037'. I then saved the selected features as a geojson using EPSG:2264. Once I re-opened both the CSV and geojson in QGIS, I joined the tables using "County" and "NAME". From there I was able to make the choropleth maps for cases, cases per 10k residents, deaths, and deaths per 10k residents. For each choropleth map I also created a new layer with the labeling of counties with higher counts/rates so that the reader could easily identify which counties those are. To do this I duplicated the choropleth layer, used single symbol symbology, selected for only the desired counties, saved the selected features as a new layer, and then applied labels for counties.
